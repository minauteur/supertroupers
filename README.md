# supertroupers

RPG (Random Poetry Generator) built in rust.
Excuse the absurd overuse of `println!()`--when this project was originally built, it was for the purpose of teaching while coding. Originally, there were plans to move the underlying API behind Amethyst or another GUI framework, however several of the students had 0 prior programming experience and so the macro was called again and again while fundamentals were explained :)

# OK, how do I install it?
TWO WAYS!
### Option 1) Running from Source:
* Install the Rust programming language for whatever platform you run (Windows, Linux, MacOS),
	`git clone https://github.com/minauteur/supertroupers.git` and then `cd supertroupers`
	before finally `cargo run`-ing from the supertroupers directory.
### Option 2) Download and Run the Latest Binary:
#### Windows:
* Download the Windows binary [here](https://github.com/minauteur/supertroupers/releases/download/0.0.1/supertroupers_v0.0.1_WINDOWS.zip), unzip the contents to a folder, and run `supertroupers.exe` from an `ANSI`-friendly terminal
#### Mac: 
* Download the Mac binary [here](https://github.com/minauteur/supertroupers/releases/download/0.0.1/supertroupers_v0.0.1_MACOS.zip), unzip the contents 		to a folder, and double-click suptertroupers!

# OK, but how do I play it?
1) Search for an author... or don't
2) Search for a title... or don't 
3) Write infinity poetries!

## --a note!
be careful making highly generic searches! It takes a minute or two for all the material to come back/to generate poems when that's the case, but it should still work. 
Just chill a bit while the beatniks do they thang!

Finally, DO let me know if anything breaks or sucks super hard so I can try to fix those things in the fundamental code before we move on to adding graphics and other bells and whistles!
TWEET ME YOUR POEMS!

* Extract names and poems from saved for insertion into corpus DONE.
* get rid of the abhorrent coloring implementation, KINDA DONE.
* implement user-inserted lines/seeds -- MAYBE
